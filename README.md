Sleep Detection
===============

**Sleep Detection** is a proof of concept application for Windows that will detect when a driver is falling asleep and alert him or her accordingly.

We keep a project backlog in out [Trello board](https://trello.com/board/sleep-detection/51cd7c144853d97c230013c2) in case you feel like watching what we are up to.
